TODOS:

Overall:
- Create API endpoints for:
	- get all teams in league
	- get all team stats
	- see all players in team
	- all free agents
- create a simple frontend that calls the backend to
	- display all teams
	- see table of team stats
	- see all player stats
	- see free agents



Data Collection:
- get data for each player (async)
- get aggregate data for entire team roster
- get overall team stats for cats ranked


- get free agents

- move functionality to write into a sqlite db, and init classes from db

Front End:
- Create a flask website
- see all teams
- see standings for the year
- see stats for team for each cat ranked totals
- show percentiles/coloured rankings to show cats of strength/weakness

Auth:
- Automatically get access code (maybe using selenium?) (https://github.com/josuebrunel/yahoo-oauth), to populate instead of hard-coding it


Concrete next goals:
- get yahoo data, and be able to get data for season, or for recent date ranges
- simple UI to view my league, team rankings, individual team rankings, overview of team and performance
- integrate other data source
- start to run own simple projections

Longer term ideas:
- simple projections
- advanced stats
- positional fantasy value created above average
- identify pickup targets in free agency (better if can be isolated by position)
- identify sleepers or buy/sell low/high candidates
- identify trade targets
